# 📦 v0.0.0-dev.1 — Introducing `@fizzwiz/search`

We’re thrilled to announce the **first prerelease** of `@fizzwiz/search`: **v0.0.0-dev.1** — the *First Brick* in a library dedicated to **declarative, lazy search abstractions** for complex computational spaces.

## Core Features in this Release

* `Search` — synchronous, lazy search for combinatorial or infinite spaces
* `AsyncSearch` — asynchronous, parallelized search for distributed or concurrent workloads
* Fully lazy, fluent, and extensible API
* Compatible with any queue strategy (FIFO, DFS, priority queues, custom)

> 🧪 This is a **prerelease**. Your feedback is essential for shaping the API’s evolution and the next features of `@fizzwiz/search`.

*“Explore freely. Push limits. Capture the wonder of computation.”*
